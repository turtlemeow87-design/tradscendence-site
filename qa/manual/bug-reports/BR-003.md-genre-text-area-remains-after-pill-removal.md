## Summary
Removing the "Other" genre selection via the pill × button does not hide the custom genre textarea. The textarea only hides correctly when "Other" is unchecked through the dropdown.

## Environment
- **URL:** https://www.soundbeyondborders.com/contact
- **Browser:** Chrome
- **Type:** UI Behavior

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to `/contact`
2. Open the **Genre(s)** dropdown
3. Check "Other" — textarea appears
4. Close the dropdown
5. Click the × button on the "Other" pill

## Expected Result
Textarea labeled "Describe the genre(s) / vibe" hides when "Other" is removed via pill × button

## Actual Result
Textarea remains visible even though the "Other" pill has been removed and the dropdown shows no selections

## Fix Applied
Added `dispatchEvent(new Event('change'))` to the pill remove button logic in `contact.astro` so that unchecking via pill triggers the same visibility listener as unchecking via the dropdown.

## Verification
Pending — retest after fix is deployed
