<h1 class="font-display text-3xl">About</h1>
<p>Although I have great respect for the relevance that different styles of music have to their native cultures, I also like to think about how not just the music, but the sound that the instruments produce can bring magic to the many genres that exist outside of those borders and across the world.  Much of the time, this idea is completely overlooked due to lack of availability, awareness, and access to experiencing the sound of these instruments first hand; and other times overlooked because many assume that certain sounds are only associated with and confined to one area of the world.  </p>
<p>This is where I come in.  Music is a language that we can all understand, no matter what part of the world you are from, and we all understand and communicate with it in different ways.  With the advent of electronics, these days, we are able to produce sound however we like, and for many, it is all that they ever hear.  During these times, the organic beauty of acoustic instruments is almost becoming lost.  I am here to bring them back to you and your special moments...  </p>
